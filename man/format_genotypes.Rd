\arguments{
\item{genotypes}{Genotype calls.}

\item{vcf}{If TRUE, will write a VCF file in the current directory.}

\item{vcfName}{VCF file name. Only effective when vcf=TRUE.}

\item{GP_cutoff}{Genotypes with the highest genotype probability < GP_cutoff will be treated as missing. Only non-missing genotypes will be used to calculate MAF, R2, and HWE p value.}

\item{R2_cutoff_up, R2_cutoff_down}{R-square cutoffs to filter variants (Variants with R-square > R2_cutoff_up or < R2_cutoff_down should be removed). Note that for VCF output, variants with R-square outside this range will be marked in the \code{FILTER} column. For the returned dosage matrix, variants with R-square outside this range will be removed.}

\item{MAF_cutoff}{MAF cutoff to filter variants. Note that for VCF output, variants with MAF below the cutoff will be marked in the \code{FILTER} column. For the returned dosage matrix, variants with MAF below the cutoff will be removed.}

\item{HWE_cutoff}{HWE p value cutoff to filter variants. Note that for VCF output, variants with HWE p value below the cutoff will be marked in the \code{FILTER} column. For the returned dosage matrix, variants with HWE p value below the cutoff will be removed.}

\item{missing_cutoff}{Missing rate cutoff to filter variants. Note that for VCF output, variants with missing rate above the cutoff will be marked in the \code{FILTER} column. For the returned dosage matrix, variants with missing rate above the cutoff will be removed.}

\item{pop}{Population to be used to extract AFs. One of EAS, AMR, AFR, EUR, SAS, and ALL.}

\item{type}{One of snp_probe, typeI_ccs_probe, and typeII_ccs_probe.}

\item{plotAF}{To plot the distribution of AFs in 1KGP and input data.}

\item{platform}{EPIC or 450K.}
}
\value{
A matrix of genotype calls. Variants with R2 or MAF beyond the cutoffs are removed. Genotypes with the highest genotype probability < GP_cutoff will be marked as NA.
